# GoodluckCaiserMalata-MathGarden


## Description: 
This project aims to incorporate a machine learning model into a web app to classify handwritten digits. Users have to attempt to answer the sum of two numbers by drawing their answers on the canvas. Then the userâ€™s answer is processed to produce a tensor, and it is from there where the model classifies the tensor into a corresponding digit.  


## Libraries used: 

Tensorflow and NumPy.
